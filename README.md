# 🧠 An Apriori Algorithm-Based Association Rule Analysis to Detect Human Suicidal Behaviour  

---

## 🌟 **Overview**  

Suicide is a major cause of death and a complex public health issue. With timely intervention and understanding of risk patterns, many instances can be prevented. This project aims to identify patterns and risk factors associated with suicidal behavior to enable effective prevention strategies.

The analysis uses **Association Rule Mining** with the **Apriori algorithm** to uncover relationships between contributing factors and suicidal behavior. These patterns provide insights into risk factors and suggest opportunities for intervention.

---

## 🔍 **Objective**
- **Identify Risk Factors**: Determine key risk factors contributing to suicidal behavior.  
- **Understand Patterns**: Analyze relationships among multiple influencing variables.  
- **Develop Insights**: Provide actionable insights for mental health care intervention strategies.

---

## 🛠️ **Methodology**
The **Apriori Algorithm** is a powerful machine learning technique for discovering frequent patterns, associations, and relationships in a database. This project applies the Apriori method to identify association rules in a dataset of 150 instances, focusing on **6 impactful features**, such as:  
- **Daily Activities**  
- **Family Background**  
- **Mental Health Questionnaire Responses**

Using this approach, the goal is to determine combinations of these variables that are associated with suicidal behavior.

---

## 📊 **Key Findings**  
- Identified **11 significant association rules** with a confidence level of **0.65**.
- These rules highlight combinations of contributing factors that correlate strongly with suicidal behavior, offering key insights for mental health interventions.

## 🚀 **Tech Stack**
- **Algorithm**: Apriori Association Rule Mining  
- **Tools & Frameworks**: Python, Pandas, Machine Learning Libraries  
- **Data Analysis**: Statistical Analysis on survey and mental health response data  

---

## ⚠️ **Limitations**
1. **Dataset Size**: Limited to 150 instances, which may affect generalizability.  
2. **Complexity of Human Behavior**: Patterns identified are based on statistical analysis but don't account for all contributing external factors.  

---

## 💬 **Future Scope**
- Increase dataset size to improve the accuracy and generalizability of predictions.  
- Explore other machine learning algorithms for comparison with Apriori-based findings.  
- Integrate findings into real-time mental health care models and interventions.
